Live version here: [spellbook app](https://chapelr.github.io/spellbook/).  You can also download this repo to run the app locally.

Source code: [https://github.com/ChapelR/spellbook-source](https://github.com/ChapelR/spellbook-source)

### Errors:

If you encounter errors or formatting issues in the spells or their descriptions, please open an issue here or at the source code repository.

### Bugs:

If you encounter any issues with the app itself, please open an issue and give me as much info as you can (what you were doing or trying to do, what happened that shouldn't have, etc).

### Suggestions:

If you have feature suggestions, feel free to open a new issue and let me know.

### Content:

If I'm missing SRD spells, please let me know.

If you'd like to see spells from outside the SRD in the app, I'll eventually be adding a custom spell interface.  You will then be able to create a spellbook of the spells you want added and export it and send it here.
